## Welcome!

I'm Brandon, a college student learing **Cybersecurity** based in the U.S.

I like to tinker with all sorts of stuff ranging from your basic web stuff to lower-level things. Expect to see some random projects using those around here.

I hope you have fun talking a look at some of my projects. Well, if a majority of them aren't _private_, anyway.
